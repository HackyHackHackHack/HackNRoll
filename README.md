# HackNRoll 2022 Submission

## MEOW :cat: is designed to be last word in social networking.

MEOW is an app that's part of the Cat package, and for a pure annoyance and with a few authentications,
MEOW will send a Telegram message, Automated Voice Call, SMS all at once to your contacts!


But why tell you about it, when we can **show** you? Contact us or Fork this repository for contribution queries and we can together build the most explosive social network ever!
